# java-final-proj

This project was made in an effort to help a supervisor communicate with subordinates the needs of a shipping dock.

It was written with a java script frontend and a rails backend api.  

The dock space that I work at has sections for doors and within the section there are door ranges 3-5 doors and then wall spaces.  
This is how the program is grouped as well the dock as a whole.  I also added a section for discoveries and a discovery will change the docks to 
show what was found on a discovery.  I added functionality in order to look at the list of discoveries and delete them if you aare no longer using them.


I used the seed file to set the dock's parameters as I treat it more like a game board with toggles that can be changed.  the game board or dock is 
set in stone what it is shaped like.  If you would look to do any modifications to the dock there for personalization.  

After downloading you will have to bundle install and db:migrate afterwords you just need to open the index.html in the frontend and you cn start walking your docks!
